# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The `Heritability` repository contains R and SAS codes for a number of methods for heritability estimation in plant breeding. It was originally created as supplemental material to 

> Schmidt, P., Hartung, J., Bennewitz, J., & Piepho, H. P. (2019). **Heritability in Plant Breeding on a Genotype-Difference Basis**. Genetics, genetics-302134. DOI: [10.1534/genetics.119.302134](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.119.302134).
 
Please navigate to the individual folders in that repository and read the respective `Readme.md` files for more information.
